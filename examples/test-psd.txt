# Test PSD Files

This folder is set up for testing the PSD to PNG Converter.

## How to Test:

1. **Place PSD Files**: Copy some Adobe Photoshop PSD files into the `input/` folder
2. **Run the Application**: Use `cargo run --release` or the provided scripts
3. **Test Drag & Drop**: Drag the `input` folder onto the application
4. **Select Output**: Choose the `output` folder as the destination
5. **Convert**: Click "Start Conversion" and watch the progress

## Sample Workflow:

```
1. Copy your PSD files to: examples/input/
2. Run the application
3. Drag examples/input/ onto the app
4. Select examples/output/ as output folder
5. Click "Start Conversion"
6. Check examples/output/ for converted PNG files
```

## Expected Results:

- All PSD files in the input folder will be converted to PNG format
- The folder structure will be preserved
- Progress will be shown in real-time
- Any errors will be displayed clearly

## Notes:

- The converter works best with standard PSD files
- Complex layer effects may not convert perfectly
- Large files may take some time to process
- Make sure you have write permissions to the output folder
